## Configuration Files

### .env (Root Level)
Main configuration file containing all environment variables for the project.

### terraform.tfvars (Auto-generated)
This file is automatically generated from your `.env` file during deployment. 
It contains all the Terraform-specific variables and should not be manually edited.

### config.json (Auto-generated in frontend/)
Generated during deployment with the actual API Gateway URL for the frontend.

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Configure**: Edit `.env` with your values
2. **Deploy**: Run `./scripts/deploy.sh`
3. **Use**: Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser

The deployment script automatically:
- Generates `terraform.tfvars` from `.env`
- Creates the Lambda deployment package
- Deploys infrastructure with Terraform
- Updates frontend configuration
- Creates a deployment summary
